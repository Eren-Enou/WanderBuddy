To host the app on Netlify, you'll need to develop it using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can also use popular frontend frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular to enhance the user experience. For the backend, you might consider using serverless functions with Node.js or Python.

Remember to integrate with Netlify's continuous deployment feature, so whenever you push new updates to your app's repository, Netlify will automatically build and deploy the latest version to your hosting environment.

Always consider user data privacy and security while building the app. You may also want to explore monetization options, such as offering premium features or displaying relevant travel ads.

Once you have a functional prototype ready, you can deploy it to Netlify and share the link with friends or potential users to gather feedback and improve the app further. Good luck with your WanderBuddy app!
